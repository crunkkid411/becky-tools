# CLAUDE.md — the one file every agent reads first

This is the canonical front door for **any** Claude Code instance working on
becky-tools — whether it's the cloud/web agent (no GPU, no models, no ffmpeg) or
the local agent on Jordan's Windows 10 PC (the real models + GPU live there).
Claude Code loads this file automatically, so it is the single source of truth
for *how we work*. The other markdown files are reference material; this file
tells you which one to open and when (see **Doc map** below).

Jordan is **not a developer** and prefers agents to do everything end to end.
Keep changes small, single-purpose, and obvious. Explain what broke in plain
language, never assume terminal fluency.

---

## 1. What becky-tools is (30-second version)

Offline, deterministic CLI tools for forensic analysis of video/audio — WHO is in
it, WHAT is said (timestamped), WHAT happens on screen, WHERE. Each tool does ONE
thing: file/JSON in → JSON out → exit code. Go binaries (`becky-go/`) with the
heavy ML pushed into thin embedded-Python helpers (`becky-go/internal/pyhelpers/`)
that call local models (Parakeet ASR, InsightFace, sherpa-onnx, Qwen3, llama.cpp).

**The single-tool principle is load-bearing.** Tools must stay independent and
composable so that when one breaks it is *obvious which one* and the rest keep
working. Never let the suite become one fragile mega-project. A new capability is
a new tool, not a tangle added to an existing one.

---

## 2. Invariants — do not relearn these the hard way

These are settled and each was a real bug or measured failure. Full reasoning in
`FORENSIC-OUTPUT-PHILOSOPHY.md` and README's "Non-obvious decisions".

- **Corroborate, then CONCLUDE — don't hedge.** ≥2 independent signals agreeing →
  state the conclusion plainly. A lone weak signal → "unknown"/candidate. A flood
  of maybes a human must sort = tool failure.
- **Recall is for DETECTION, not NAMING.** Surface every face/voice; attach a NAME
  only when corroborated.
- **Offline + deterministic.** No network at runtime; same input → same output
  (fixed seeds). The only "AI in the loop" is an explicit local model call.
- **Degrade, never crash.** Missing model/ffmpeg/audio → typed degrade error and a
  partial result, not a panic.
- **Paths may be Windows paths even when running on Linux/CI.** Use
  `internal/pathx` (separator-agnostic Base/Dir), not `filepath.Base` on a value
  that originated as a `C:\...` path. (This is why CI is green on Linux.)

---

## 3. Build & test

```bash
# From becky-go/ — works on Windows and Linux, needs only the Go toolchain.
go build ./...      # compile every tool
go test ./...       # run every unit test (no models/ffmpeg/GPU needed)
go vet ./...
gofmt -l .          # must print nothing
```

```bat
REM Windows-only: produce the actual .exe binaries Jordan runs.
cd becky-go && build-all-tools.bat
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs build + test + vet + gofmt on **both** Ubuntu
and Windows for every push and PR. Green CI means the deterministic Go layer is
sound. CI does **not** exercise the ML path (no model weights / GPU on CI) — that
is validated locally on real footage.

## 4. Cloud ↔ Local handoff protocol

The two agents split the work along the **model boundary**:

| Cloud / web agent (here)                       | Local agent (Jordan's Win10 PC)            |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Deep research, model/library selection         | Real ML inference + GPU runs               |
| Tool specs (`SPEC-*.md` in the house style)    | ffmpeg / media-dependent end-to-end tests  |
| Go scaffolding, CLI, JSON schema, fusion logic | Wiring the Python helper to the real model |
| **Unit tests** for all deterministic logic     | Accuracy/recall tuning on real evidence    |
| Push to branch + open **draft PR**             | `build-all-tools.bat`, run on real clips   |

**Rules of the baton:**
1. The cloud agent works on its assigned `claude/*` branch and opens a **draft
   PR** — it does **not** push to `master`.
2. Every Python helper the cloud agent can't run is left as a documented stub with
   an explicit input/output contract, so the local agent only has to plug in the
   model call.
3. The **live status of the current branch** lives in section 6 below. The cloud
   agent updates it before ending a session; the local agent reads it first.

### Copy-paste prompt for the local agent

When the cloud agent has pushed a branch, Jordan pastes this into his **local**
Claude Code (filling in the branch name from the chat or the PR):

> Pull the branch `<BRANCH-NAME>` from origin and check it out (create a local
> tracking branch if needed). Read `CLAUDE.md` section 6 ("Live handoff") for what
> the cloud agent finished and what's left for you. Then: run `go build ./...` and
> `go test ./...` in `becky-go/` to confirm it's green on this machine; wire up any
> Python helper stubs listed in the handoff to their real local models; run
> `build-all-tools.bat`; and test the new/changed tool against a real clip. Report
> what passed, what degraded, and anything that needs my input. Commit to the same
> branch.

### Minimal trigger — Jordan does NOT paste the long prompt

Jordan is non-dev and copy-pasting the prompt above into the local TUI is broken
and slow for him (observed 2026-06-14). So the local agent must accept a **tiny
trigger** as equivalent to the full prompt. When Jordan says anything like **"grab
the latest cloud branch"** / "pull the cloud agent's work" / "continue the
handoff", do the whole sequence automatically:

1. `git fetch origin`, then check out the **newest** `claude/*` branch.
2. Read section 6 below (what's done / what's left).
3. In `becky-go/`: `go build ./...` and `go test ./...`. (A `gofmt -l .` complaint
   that is only CRLF line-endings on Windows is cosmetic — do not let it block.)
4. If green and the branch is non-blocking, fast-forward merge into `master`,
   push, and delete the merged branch (local + remote). Otherwise report plainly.

Never make Jordan paste the long version. The only thing he should ever have to
say is the short trigger.

## 5. Doc map — which file, when

**Canonical (read these):**
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — how we work + live handoff.
- `README.md` — project overview, tool catalog, non-obvious decisions.
- `SKILL.md` — how to *use* the tools (human + agent usage guide).
- `FORENSIC-OUTPUT-PHILOSOPHY.md` — how findings must be reported. Governs every
  human-facing output.

**Specs (read the one for the tool you're building):**
- `SPEC-BECKY-ASK.md`, `SPEC-BECKY-NEW-TOOL.md`, `SPEC-OCR.md`,
  `SPEC-PERSON-CLUSTERING.md`, `SPEC-VIDEO-ANALYSIS.md`.
- `BUILD-AGENT-BRIEFING.md` — briefing for a subagent building one tool.

**Historical / inbox (context only — not current instructions):**
- `PROGRESS.md` — build-loop tracker/log.
- `TEST-FEEDBACK.md` — hand-off inbox from the test agent.
- `TRANSCRIPT-GAP-FINDINGS.md`, `MORNING-BRIEF-2026-06-09.md` — dated R&D notes.

> If this list and the files ever disagree, this list wins — tell Jordan so it can
> be corrected. New planning docs should be linked here so the root never becomes
> "scattered .md files" again.

## 6. Live handoff — current branch status

**Branch:** `claude/affectionate-pascal-z35plh`

**Done by cloud agent:**
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — build + test + vet + gofmt on Ubuntu + Windows.
- Added `internal/pathx` (separator-agnostic Base/Dir) + tests.
- Fixed 3 Windows-path unit tests that failed on Linux/CI (export `defaultOutput`,
  osintexport `deriveFFprobe`, avlm frame-file labelling). Full suite now green on
  Linux (`go test ./...` → exit 0).
- Added this `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical front door + handoff protocol.

**Left for local agent:** nothing blocking — this branch is infra/cleanup only.
Pull it, confirm `go test ./...` is green on Windows too, and merge when happy.

**Next planned work (specs/scaffolding, not yet started):** four new tools —
(1) iPhone-history research ingester + synthesizer, (2) becky-ask UX overhaul
(clipboard/drag-drop/mouse), (3) an agent harness for repetitive workflows,
(4) **becky-handoff** — a CLI that finds the newest `claude/*` branch, prints
section 6 (done/left) in plain language, runs `go build`/`go test`, and offers to
merge — so the cloud→local handoff is one command instead of a pasted prompt.
Requested by Jordan 2026-06-14 (pasting the prompt is broken for a non-dev). Spec
it in the house style before any code; pairs with the "Minimal trigger" in §4.
