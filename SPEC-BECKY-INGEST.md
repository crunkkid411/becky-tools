## 1. Purpose + the user need (one paragraph)

`becky ingest <folder> --kb kb-final` runs the whole forensic chain over a folder of
clips with ONE command, and then writes **one human-readable `DIGEST.md`** that, per
clip, states the **capture-time**, a plain-language **who / what / where** summary, and
the **unknowns that still need a human**. The need is concrete: a finished pipeline run
leaves 8+ raw JSON sidecars *per clip* (`transcript.json`, `diarized.json`, `events.json`,
`osint-manifest.json`, `ocr.json`, `embed.json`, `identify.json`, `motion.json`,
`validate.json`, `report.json`) — nobody, and no LLM context window, wants to read 8 JSON
files × N clips to understand a case. Today `becky-pipeline` already produces those
sidecars (`cmd/pipeline/main.go`) and `becky-report` already distills *one clip's*
sidecars into a corroborated case report (`cmd/report/main.go`, `internal/report`). What
is missing is the **corpus-level front door**: a single verb that drives the pipeline over
the folder *and* rolls every clip's `report.json` up into one skimmable `DIGEST.md` an
investigator (or a downstream model) reads top-to-bottom. `becky ingest` is that verb. It
invents no new analysis — it **orchestrates** the existing tools and **formats** their
already-corroborated output.

---

## 2. How it orchestrates the existing pipeline (and where DIGEST.md slots)

`becky ingest` is a **new op on the existing `becky` orchestrator** (`cmd/becky/main.go`),
alongside `enroll-wiki` / `index` / `find` / `corroborate`. It is a thin driver in the
exact style of the others: it shells out to existing binaries via the shared plumbing in
`cmd/becky/runner.go` (`commonFlags.binPath`, `runTool`) and **re-implements no analysis**.

Pipeline flow (nothing here is new analysis — every box already exists):

```
becky ingest <folder> --kb kb-final
   │
   ├─(1) shell: becky-pipeline <folder> --out <out> --kb <kb> --steps <set> [--resume]
   │        → runs the forensic chain per clip; writes <out>/<stem>/*.json + <out>/manifest.json
   │          (cmd/pipeline/main.go: processVideo → runStep; canonicalOrder in steps.go)
   │
   ├─(2) read <out>/manifest.json (cmd/pipeline/manifest.go: Manifest, VideoResult, StepResult)
   │        → the authoritative list of clips, per-step status, output dirs
   │
   ├─(3) per clip, build the corroborated report from its sidecars
   │        report.LoadSidecars(transcript, events, identify, motion)  (internal/report/load.go)
   │        report.Build(sidecars, stem)                                (internal/report/build.go)
   │        + read the capture-time / GPS block from <stem>/osint-manifest.json
   │          (the metadata field — exifmeta.Metadata, cmd/osint/osint.go:142)
   │
   └─(4) format ONE DIGEST.md from all per-clip reports + the manifest
            (NEW internal/digest formatter — §3)
            → <out>/DIGEST.md  +  <out>/digest.json (machine manifest, §4)
```

**Relationship to `becky-report` (reuse, do not reinvent):**
- `becky-report` is **per-clip**: it turns one clip's sidecars into one `report.json` /
  `report.md` and is *already a pipeline step* (`stepReport` in `cmd/pipeline/steps.go:30`,
  `reportStepArgs` in `cmd/pipeline/run.go:144`). `becky ingest` does **not** duplicate its
  corroboration logic — it calls `report.Build` (`internal/report/build.go:23`) directly so
  the "≥2 signals → DOCUMENTED" rule lives in exactly one place (`applyCorroboration`,
  `build.go:181`).
- `DIGEST.md` is **corpus-level**: it is a roll-up of every clip's `report.Report` into one
  document, *plus two things `report.Report` doesn't carry today*: (a) **capture-time +
  location** (those live in the osint metadata block, `exifmeta.Metadata` — not in the four
  sidecars `report.LoadSidecars` reads), and (b) an explicit **"Unknowns"** section per clip
  (driven from `report.ReviewItems` + `identifyOutput.Unidentified`, `internal/report/load.go:135`).
- `becky-report`'s own markdown (`internal/report/markdown.go:Markdown`) is **not** reused
  verbatim for the digest: it is per-clip, uses GitHub tables and emoji icons (`signalTable`,
  the `| Time | Type | … |` timeline, `✅`/`⚫`), which is the wrong shape for a skimmable,
  accessibility-clean corpus digest (see §3 + §5). The digest gets its **own linear
  formatter**; it reuses the report **data** (`report.Report`), not its rendering.

So the build order is: **(prefer) ask the pipeline to run `report` as a step** so each
`<stem>/report.json` already exists, then `becky ingest` just loads each `report.json` +
each `osint-manifest.json` and formats the digest. If a clip's `report.json` is missing
(report step absent/failed), `becky ingest` falls back to building the report itself in-
process via `report.Build` over whatever sidecars exist (§5). Either way the corroboration
math is `internal/report`'s, never re-coded.

---

## 3. The exact DIGEST.md layout

Design goals, in priority order: **skimmable, linear, plain-language, honest about
unknowns.** Per `FORENSIC-OUTPUT-PHILOSOPHY.md`: DOCUMENTED facts stated plainly by name;
CANDIDATE/unknown items flagged with their basis, never hedged into mush, never asserted.
Per `ACCESSIBILITY.md` (Jordan is low-vision, **sighted** — concise, high-contrast-friendly,
no screen-reader assumptions but also no meaning-by-color): **no GitHub tables, no emoji-
as-data, no ascii-art** — headings + short labelled lines a person scans and a model parses.

The file has a top **case summary**, then one **section per clip**, then a **corpus
unknowns roll-up**.

```markdown

## 1. reddit-livestream-2025-08-14.mp4

When (capture-time): 2025-08-14 19:32:07 (-05:00)  [source: quicktime — trusted]
Duration: 14:22
Where: GPS 41.8781, -87.6298 (lat/long in file)   |   no on-screen address text found
Device: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (SM-S938U1)

Who:
- John Clancy — DOCUMENTED (voice + face, confidence 0.88). Appears 0:13–2:41, 9:05–11:20.
- Shelby Reed — DOCUMENTED (voice + face + location, confidence 0.91). Appears 1:50–6:30.

What (key moments):
- 0:13 — John taps her hip, she turns it into hand-holding, he pulls her in. [DOCUMENTED, events]
- 1:02 — speech: "I want the penguin." [DOCUMENTED, transcript]
- 9:48 — sub-second motion burst (score 0.82), not visible at 1 fps — REVIEW. [CANDIDATE, motion]

Unknowns / needs a human:
- An unidentified man (candidate: Mark, voice 0.71) at 4:10 — single signal, not concluded.
- becky-validate ran but found 0 observations on this clip — re-check the 9:48 window by eye.

Sidecars: pipeline-out/reddit-livestream-2025-08-14/  (report.json, transcript.json, …)

## 2. <next clip>.mp4
…(same shape)…

---

## Corpus unknowns (everything still needing a human)

- reddit-livestream-2025-08-14.mp4 @ 4:10 — unidentified man, candidate "Mark" (voice 0.71).
- backyard-2025-08-29.mov @ 0:00 — capture-time fell back to file mtime (UNTRUSTED) — date unverified.
- (3 clips skipped identify: no --kb match — listed under each clip above.)

## Notes
- 1 clip is PARTIAL: garden-clip.mkv — becky-diarize failed (see manifest.json).
- becky-validate was not run (no GPU model available); motion bursts are localized but undescribed.
```

**Per-clip section contract (the load-bearing layout):**

| Line | Source field | Behaviour when missing |
|---|---|---|
| `## N. <stem>.<ext>` | `VideoResult.Input` / `report.Report.Source` | always present |
| `When (capture-time):` | osint `metadata.capture_time_local` + `utc_offset` + `capture_time_source` (`exifmeta.Metadata`, `exiftool.go:setCaptureTimes`) | `unknown — no capture tag` |
| `Duration:` | `report.Report.Duration` (`build.go:clipDuration`) → `formatTime` | omit line if 0 |
| `Where:` | osint `metadata.gps` + any OCR'd address text | `no location signal` |
| `Device:` | osint `metadata.device_name` / make+model | omit line if absent |
| `Who:` | `report.Report.Entities` (DOCUMENTED first, then CANDIDATE), `Appearances` → spans | `nobody identified` |
| `What (key moments):` | `report.Report.Conclusions` + high-signal `Timeline` moments | `no notable moments` |
| `Unknowns / needs a human:` | `report.Report.ReviewItems` + identify `Unidentified` + per-step degrade notes | `none flagged` |
| `Sidecars:` | the clip's `<out>/<stem>/` dir + the file names present | always (the audit trail) |

**Forensic-output rules baked into the formatter** (these are assertions the unit tests
check, §7): the `capture_time_source` is **always shown** and the word **UNTRUSTED** is
emitted verbatim when the source is `mtime(untrusted)` (`exifmeta.SourceMTime`,
`exifmeta.go:32`) — a copied/synced file's mtime must never read as a capture time; a
DOCUMENTED person is written **by name with no hedging**; a CANDIDATE is written with its
single-signal basis and confidence and the words "not concluded" / "REVIEW"; sub-second
motion bursts carry the "not visible at 1 fps" note from `build.go:271`. The "Unknowns"
section is **never empty-by-omission** — if there are no unknowns it says `none flagged`,
so a reader can trust that absence means "nothing pending," not "the tool forgot."

## 4. CLI flags + behaviour + the JSON manifest

```
becky ingest <folder> [--kb <dir>] [--out <dir>] [--steps <set>]
                      [--bin <dir>] [--resume] [--force]
                      [--digest <path>] [--no-pipeline] [--verbose] [--json]
```

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `<folder>` (positional) | the corpus folder of clips to ingest | required |
| `--kb <dir>` | knowledge base for the `identify` step | "" (identify skipped) |
| `--out <dir>` | pipeline output root (passed straight to `becky-pipeline --out`) | `pipeline-out` |
| `--steps <set>` | step set passed to `becky-pipeline --steps`; `report` is force-appended if absent so each clip has a `report.json` | the ingest default set, below |
| `--bin <dir>` | where `becky-*.exe` live (shared `commonFlags`, `runner.go:binPath`) | next to the running binary |
| `--resume` | skip clips/steps already done (forwarded to `becky-pipeline`; the pipeline is already resumable/idempotent, `cmd/pipeline/main.go:82`) | off |
| `--force` | re-run every step (forwarded) | off |
| `--digest <path>` | where to write DIGEST.md | `<out>/DIGEST.md` |
| `--no-pipeline` | **skip running the pipeline**; only (re)build the digest from existing `<out>/` sidecars — fast, offline, no models needed (the cloud-runnable / re-format path, §6) | off |
| `--verbose` | progress on stderr (`headline` / `beckyio.Logf`) | off |
| `--json` | suppress the plain-English headline; still writes digest.json (`commonFlags.jsonOut`, `runner.go:64`) | off |

**Default `--steps`:** the deterministic sweep `becky-pipeline` runs by default
(`transcribe,metadata,diarize,events,osint,ocr` — `cmd/pipeline/steps.go:64`) **plus**
`identify` when `--kb` is given, **plus** `report`. `embed`/`validate` stay opt-in (they
need the embedding server / GPU model). `becky ingest` appends `report` to whatever the
user passes so the digest's preferred input always exists.

**Behaviour:**
1. Validate `<folder>` exists and is a directory; error out cleanly otherwise (mirror
   `cmd/pipeline/main.go:65`).
2. Unless `--no-pipeline`: run `becky-pipeline` once over the folder via `runTool`
   (`runner.go:148`), forwarding `--out/--kb/--steps/--bin/--resume/--force/--verbose`.
   becky-pipeline already writes `<out>/manifest.json` and exits 0 even with partial
   clips, so a single failed step never aborts ingest.
3. Read `<out>/manifest.json` into the `Manifest` shape (`cmd/pipeline/manifest.go:8`) —
   this is the authoritative clip list (not a re-scan of the folder), so ingest reports
   exactly what the pipeline processed.
4. For each `VideoResult`: load `report.json` if present (`<out_dir>/report.json`); else
   `report.Build` in-process from the sidecars that exist (`report.LoadSidecars`). Read
   `<out_dir>/osint-manifest.json` for capture-time/GPS/device.
5. Format and write `<out>/DIGEST.md` and `<out>/digest.json`.
6. Print a one-line headline to stderr ("Digest: 12 clips, 11 ok, 1 partial → <out>/DIGEST.md")
   and the `digest.json` to stdout (the structured result, like every other `becky` op).

**`digest.json` (the machine manifest — same data as DIGEST.md, for chaining):**

```json

All slices initialised to `[]` (never `null`), RFC3339 timestamps — matching the house
conventions in `cmd/pipeline/manifest.go` and `internal/report/types.go`.

## 5. Deterministic · offline · degrade-never-crash

- **Deterministic.** The digest formatter is pure data→text: the same `<out>/` sidecars
  always yield byte-identical `DIGEST.md` (clips ordered as `manifest.json` lists them,
  which is the pipeline's sorted order; entities/findings already sorted deterministically
  in `internal/report/build.go:sortFindings`/`sortSpans`). `generated_at` is the one
  non-deterministic field (a timestamp) — isolate it so tests can pin it (pass a clock, as
  `report.Build` uses `time.Now().UTC()` once at `build.go:26`).
- **Offline (the formatter half).** `--no-pipeline` builds the digest with **zero** model,
  network, ffmpeg, or GPU calls — pure file-read + format. This is the cloud-runnable proof
  path (§6) and the everyday "re-format after I read it" path. The pipeline half (step 2)
  is exactly as online/heavy as `becky-pipeline` already is — ingest adds nothing.
- **Degrade-never-crash, at three layers:**
  1. **Missing pipeline step / sidecar** → that clip's section simply omits the line and,
     where it matters, says so (`no location signal`, `capture-time: unknown`). `report.Build`
     already degrades over missing sidecars (`report.LoadSidecars` leaves fields nil,
     `internal/report/load.go:21`; `Build` sets `Degraded=true` when nothing useful exists,
     `build.go:48`). A degraded clip is rendered as a stub section + a note, never skipped
     silently and never a panic.
  2. **Missing `report.json` for a clip** → fall back to in-process `report.Build` over
     whatever sidecars are on disk.
  3. **Missing `manifest.json`** (e.g. `--no-pipeline` against a dir that was never run) →
     fall back to scanning `<out>/*/` subdirs for sidecars, emit a note, exit 0 with a
     partial digest. `<folder>` itself missing → clean usage error (non-zero), the one
     genuine fatal.
- **Read-only / no source mutation.** Like the rest of the suite, ingest only reads the
  source clips and writes under `<out>/`; it never modifies a source video (the pipeline's
  invariant, `cmd/pipeline/main.go:22`).
- **Exit codes:** 0 on success (incl. partial clips + degraded sections); non-zero only on
  a usage error (`<folder>` missing) or a write failure for `DIGEST.md`. A degraded *digest*
  (no useful data anywhere in the corpus) sets `digest.json.degraded=true` and is noted in
  DIGEST.md but still exits 0 (the operator gets the empty-but-honest digest).

---

## 6. Cloud-vs-local split

The model boundary cuts cleanly between the **pipeline** (heavy, local) and the **digest
formatter** (deterministic, cloud-buildable).

| Cloud agent CAN build + verify (no GPU/models/ffmpeg) | Local agent (Jordan's PC) finishes |
|---|---|
| The new `internal/digest` package: `Build(reports, manifest, meta) Digest` + `Markdown(Digest) string` + `digest.json` encoder. | Run `becky ingest <real folder> --kb kb-final` end-to-end on real footage (needs Parakeet/ffmpeg/InsightFace/GPU via the pipeline). |
| The `becky ingest` op in `cmd/becky` (flag parsing via `runner.go` helpers, the `becky-pipeline` argv, manifest+sidecar loading). | Confirm capture-time/GPS render correctly from a real `osint-manifest.json` (exiftool/ffprobe present locally). |
| The capture-time/GPS extraction *from an existing osint-manifest.json* (it is plain JSON; reuse `exifmeta.Metadata`'s field tags — no probe call). | Sound/eyes check that the DIGEST reads well for a real case; tune thresholds for "key moments." |
| **The one-command offline proof:** `becky ingest <fixture-out> --no-pipeline --digest /tmp/DIGEST.md` over a committed fixture `pipeline-out/` of hand-authored sidecars → assert the DIGEST.md content (byte-diff against a golden file). This exercises the real formatter code path with no hardware. | `build-all-tools.bat` (the `becky` exe is rebuilt; no new `cmd/*` since ingest is a new op on existing `cmd/becky`). |
| All unit tests (§7). | Verify `--resume` over a partially-ingested corpus. |

The cloud→local handoff therefore ships a **provable** artifact (per CLAUDE.md §2/§4 + the
`HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md` rule): the `--no-pipeline` run over the fixture is the one-command,
no-hardware proof the formatter works, and the checkboxed work order in §7 is the ordered
command list the local agent drives to completion.

---

## 7. Checkboxed build plan + the unit tests

**Build plan (cloud, in order):**

- [ ] **Create `internal/digest`** — the corpus formatter. Types: `Digest`, `ClipDigest`,
      `CorpusSummary` (mirroring the `digest.json` shape in §4). No new analysis — it
      consumes `report.Report` (`internal/report/types.go`) + a small `CaptureMeta` struct
      decoded from `osint-manifest.json`'s `metadata` block (reuse `exifmeta.Metadata`
      field tags; do NOT call exiftool/ffprobe — read the already-written JSON).
- [ ] `digest.Build(reports []report.Report, captures map[string]CaptureMeta, m PipelineManifest, clock func() time.Time) Digest`
      — deterministic assembly; clip order = manifest order; corpus people = union of
      concluded entity names; earliest/latest capture from the trusted capture times.
- [ ] `digest.Markdown(Digest) string` — the §3 linear layout. **No tables, no emoji-as-
      data** (a deliberate departure from `internal/report/markdown.go`, justified in §2).
- [ ] `digest.JSON(Digest) ([]byte, error)` — the `digest.json` encoder (`[]` not null,
      RFC3339).
- [ ] **Add the `ingest` op to `cmd/becky`**: a new `runIngest(rest)` in a new
      `cmd/becky/ingest.go`, wired into the `switch op` in `cmd/becky/main.go:67`
      (`case "ingest": err = runIngest(rest)`), and a usage line added to the `usage`
      const (`main.go:29`). Parse flags via the existing `runner.go` helpers
      (`extractCommon`, `flagValue`, `hasFlag`).
- [ ] `runIngest`: build the `becky-pipeline` argv and run it via `runTool(cf, "pipeline", args)`
      unless `--no-pipeline`; load `<out>/manifest.json`; per clip load `report.json` (or
      `report.Build` fallback) + `osint-manifest.json`; call `digest.Build` → write
      `DIGEST.md` + `digest.json`; print headline + stdout JSON.
- [ ] Wire `report` into the forwarded `--steps` (force-append if absent).
- [ ] Document the op in `cmd/becky/main.go`'s header comment + `usage`.
- [ ] `go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./... && gofmt -l .` all green (gate 1–4).
      `build-all-tools.bat` is the local completion step (gate 5) — note it in the handoff.

**Unit tests to write (assert VALUES from fixture sidecars, never truthiness):**

- [ ] `internal/digest`: a committed fixture set — a hand-authored `report.Report` (one
      DOCUMENTED person via voice+face, one CANDIDATE single-signal unknown, one sub-second
      motion burst) + a `CaptureMeta` with a real `quicktime` capture time. Assert
      `Markdown` **contains** the person's name on the `Who:` line, the literal
      `capture_time_source` and the trusted/untrusted word, the CANDIDATE's "not concluded"
      basis, and the `Unknowns` section listing the unknown. Assert a clip with **only** an
      `mtime(untrusted)` capture emits the literal **`UNTRUSTED`** word.
- [ ] **Degrade test:** a clip whose `report.Report.Degraded==true` → renders a stub
      section with a note, the corpus still renders, no panic, `Markdown` non-empty.
- [ ] **Empty-unknowns test:** a clip with zero review items → the `Unknowns` line reads
      `none flagged` (never omitted).
- [ ] **Determinism test:** `Build`+`Markdown` over the fixture twice (fixed clock) →
      byte-identical (the regression guard).
- [ ] **Corpus roll-up test:** two clips, overlapping concluded people → `people_concluded`
      is the de-duplicated union; earliest/latest capture computed from trusted times only;
      a clip with an untrusted date appears in `unverified_dates`.
- [ ] **JSON shape test:** empty corpus → `clips: []` (not null), `degraded: true`, exit 0.
- [ ] `cmd/becky`: a `runIngest` flag/argv test (mirror `cmd/ask/plan_test.go` /
      `cmd/pipeline/steps_test.go` style) — assert the `becky-pipeline` argv built for a
      given flag set (e.g. `--kb` present → `identify` in `--steps`; `report` always
      appended), and that `--no-pipeline` skips the pipeline exec. Use a fake runner so no
      real binary is spawned.
- [ ] **Golden-file proof:** the `--no-pipeline` run over the committed fixture `out/` dir
      produces a DIGEST.md byte-identical to a checked-in `testdata/DIGEST.golden.md` (this
      doubles as the §6 one-command offline proof the local agent re-runs).

## 8. Open Decisions for Jordan

1. **Default step set.** Proposed default is `transcribe,metadata,diarize,events,osint,ocr,
   (+identify if --kb),report`. Should `embed` (corpus search index) be on by default during
   ingest, or stay opt-in (it needs the resident embedding server)? Recommend opt-in.
2. **What counts as a "key moment" in `What:`.** Proposed: all DOCUMENTED conclusions +
   sub-second motion bursts + the N highest-confidence events. Cap N at ~5 per clip so the
   digest stays skimmable, or list all? Recommend cap with a "(+k more in report.json)" line.
3. **Per-clip `report.md` too?** The pipeline can already write each clip's `report.md`
   (`stepReport`). Keep those AND the corpus DIGEST.md (the digest links to them), or have
   ingest suppress per-clip markdown to avoid clutter? Recommend keep both (DIGEST = index,
   report.md = drill-down).
4. **Folder recursion.** `becky-pipeline` scans a folder **non-recursively**
   (`discoverVideos`, `cmd/pipeline/main.go:178`). Should `becky ingest` add `--recursive`
   for nested case folders, or match the pipeline's flat behaviour? Recommend match (flat)
   for v1; add `--recursive` only if a real case needs it.
5. **Capture-time when EXIF is absent.** When the only date is `mtime(untrusted)`, the digest
   labels it UNTRUSTED and lists the clip under `unverified_dates`. Is that the right default,
   or should ingest also invoke the planned `becky dates` triangulation (README "Planned
   features") once it exists, to recover a date from in-frame timestamps? Recommend wire to
   `becky dates` later — out of scope for ingest v1.
